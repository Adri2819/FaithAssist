## High-level architecture

- This is a **Laravel 13 + Inertia.js + Vue 3** app. `routes/web.php` maps authenticated web routes to controller namespaces under `app/Http/Controllers`, and those controllers render matching Vue pages under `resources/js/Pages`.
- The application is split into three main business areas that stay mirrored across routes, controllers, pages, policies, and permissions:
  - **Regions:** states, municipalities, communities
  - **Ecclesiastes:** dioceses, deaneries, churches, chapels
  - **Security:** modules, permissions, roles, users
- The main data hierarchy is cross-cutting and matters for both UI options and authorization:
  - `state -> municipality`
  - `diocese -> municipality`
  - `municipality -> community`
  - `diocese -> deanery -> church`
  - `municipality -> church`
  - `community + church -> chapel`
- Frontend auth state is centralized in `HandleInertiaRequests`. Every page receives `page.props.auth` with the current user, profile-derived display data, flattened permission names, role names, and scope data (`municipality_ids`, `church_ids`, `full_access`).
- Most catalog screens use the same CRUD flow: the controller `index()` returns paginated Inertia props plus lookup options, while `store`, `update`, and `destroy` return JSON consumed by the shared `resources/js/components/catalogs/CatalogTable.vue`. **Users** and **roles** are exceptions and use dedicated Inertia forms plus redirects.
- User identity data is split across `users` and `profiles`; names shown in the UI are usually assembled from the related `profile`, not just `users.name`.

## Key conventions

- Permission names use **Spanish module identifiers** plus actions: `<module>.create`, `.read`, `.update`, `.delete`, `.show`. Scope overrides use `<module>.scope.all`. Keep these names aligned with policies, dashboard links, and seeders.
- The UI currently uses `.show` permissions to decide whether dashboard/navigation entries appear, while policy `viewAny()` checks usually use `.read`. When adding new modules, seed and wire both actions consistently.
- Policies extend `BasePermissionPolicy`, are registered manually in `AppServiceProvider`, and catalog controllers typically rely on `$this->authorizeResource(...)` instead of per-action authorization inside request classes.
- Data visibility is **scope-driven**. Users are assigned municipalities through `municipality_user` and churches through `church_user`. Community visibility is derived from assigned municipalities; it is not the primary scope source anymore. Chapel access is allowed when either the chapel's community is in scope or its church is in scope, unless the user has the module's `scope.all` permission.
- Many `FormRequest` classes use `UppercasesFields`, so validated text inputs for catalog entities are trimmed and uppercased before persistence. Preserve that behavior when adding new catalog requests.
- Domain models commonly use PHP attributes such as `#[Fillable]` and `#[Hidden]`, plus `SoftDeletes` and the shared `LogsActivityTrail` trait. Catalog/domain tables also include `created_by`, `updated_by`, and `deleted_by` audit columns.
- Permission grouping depends on `permissions.module_key` values (`core`, `regions`, `ecclesiastes`, `security`). Role and user forms group permissions by that field, and the seeders assume those exact buckets.
- Tests run against **in-memory SQLite** (`phpunit.xml`) and many feature tests create catalog records directly with Eloquent instead of factories. Follow that style for small authorization and scope tests.
